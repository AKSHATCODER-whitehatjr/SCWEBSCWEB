Even though your child/children would tell you what he/she did at school that day, this app will make it easier to find out. Each child has an account, just type their name on the app, and then pictures and some text about what they did at school will pop up. Now, you don't even have to ask, and what happens at school appears on the app at around the same time, so you can check, even when your child/children are at class. If there is an event, it will appear on the school calender, on the home menu </p>

You have many foods to choose, with a side, like apple sauce, fruit of the week, and more. After a month, you will have to order again, so you can change the food if you want, or you can keep the food.</p>
